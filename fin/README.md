# My Finance with Roommates

The GUI application, “My Finance with Roommates”, provides a way of keeping track of your daily expenses and other expenses 
with your roommates. In the application, the user can set the number of roommates from initial page, and edit the expense 
categories anytime. The user can analyze the monthly expense in various types of charts, and each chart has two types for 
your individual expense and group expense with your roommates. The user can also save/load the data and export the monthly 
expense to excel spreadsheet. After all, this application will help the users to understand what’s really going on with their money.
